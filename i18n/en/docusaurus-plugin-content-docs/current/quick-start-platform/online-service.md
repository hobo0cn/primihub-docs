## Service Deployment
Befor installing local services, you need to first start node service(the complete service experience usually requires more than two)
You need to install git to download the code

    git clone https://github.com/primihub/primihub-platform.git

Directory as follows：

    ├─primihub-platform
    ├─primihub-fusion
    │   ├─fusion-api
    │   └─script
    ├─primihub-service
    │   ├─application
    │   ├─biz
    │   ├─gateway
    │   └─script
    └─primihub-webconsole
